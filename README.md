Conductor is a token-efficient CLI for mobile UI interactions, built for AI agents. It's a TypeScript reimplementation and partial fork of [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev) that bundles its own native drivers — no external CLI, no setup friction, no nonsense.

It started as an experiment: what if Claude could tap through your app while it's writing the code? Turns out that's extremely useful. Now it's a proper tool.

## ✨ What it does

Conductor gives Claude Code the ability to interact with iOS simulators and Android emulators directly from a coding session. It can navigate UI, inspect the live hierarchy, take screenshots, run flows, and manage multiple devices in parallel across concurrent agents.

```bash
conductor launch-app com.example.myapp
conductor tap "Sign In"
conductor type "user@example.com"
conductor assert-visible "Dashboard"
conductor screenshot --output /tmp/screen.png
```

One agent writes the feature. Another taps through the app. They talk. It works. 🤝

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
npm install -g @houwert/conductor
```

That's it. The postinstall script registers Conductor as a Claude Code plugin automatically — Claude gains full mobile UI control without any extra steps.

## 🧠 Claude Skills

The plugin registers itself globally in `~/.claude/plugins/` and ships two skill files:

```
skills/conductor/
├── SKILL.md               # Full command reference and agent workflow guide
└── references/
    └── flow-syntax.md     # Maestro YAML flow syntax reference
```

Claude learns every available command, how to coordinate across devices, and how to write and run Maestro YAML flows. See [`skills/conductor/SKILL.md`](./skills/conductor/SKILL.md) for the full reference.

### Install modes

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install -g @houwert/conductor` | Registers global plugin automatically (via postinstall) |
| `conductor install` | Re-register or update the global plugin |
| `conductor install --skills` | Copy skills into `.claude/skills/conductor/` in the current project |
| `conductor install --check` | Print current install status without modifying anything |

### 📱 What Claude can do

| Capability | Commands |
|---|---|
| App lifecycle | `launch-app`, `stop-app`, `foreground-app` |
| Interaction | `tap`, `type`, `scroll`, `scroll-until-visible`, `swipe`, `press-key`, `erase-text`, `hide-keyboard` |
| Inspection | `inspect`, `screenshot`, `list-apps` |
| Assertions | `assert-visible`, `assert-not-visible` |
| Navigation | `open-link`, `back` |
| Flows | `run-flow`, `run-flow-inline`, `run-parallel` |
| Devices | `start-device`, `list-devices`, `set-location`, `set-orientation` |

## 🔨 Building locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js + pnpm v9
- **iOS:** Xcode with command-line tools
- **Android:** Android SDK with `adb` on `PATH`

### Full build

```bash
make build
```

Builds the iOS driver (xcodebuild), the Android driver (Gradle), packages both into the CLI, and compiles TypeScript. Then link it globally:

```bash
cd packages/cli && pnpm link --global
```

### CLI only

If the drivers are already built and packaged:

```bash
cd packages/cli
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

### Individual targets

```bash
make build-cli          # CLI TypeScript only
make build-ios-driver   # iOS XCTest driver
make build-android-driver # Android instrumentation driver
make package-cli        # Bundle drivers into CLI package
make copy-skills        # Copy skills/ into packages/cli/skills/ (build artifact)
```

## 🗂️ Repository structure

```
conductor/
├── packages/
│   ├── cli/              # TypeScript CLI (@houwert/conductor)
│   ├── android-driver/   # Kotlin/Gradle instrumentation driver
│   └── ios-driver/       # Swift/Xcode XCTest driver
└── Makefile
```

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
pnpm dev     # TypeScript watch mode
pnpm lint    # ESLint + Prettier check
pnpm lint:fix  # Auto-fix formatting
pnpm test    # Run test suite
```

## 📋 Requirements

- **iOS:** Xcode with a booted simulator
- **Android:** `adb` on `PATH` with a running emulator or connected device
